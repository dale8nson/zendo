A full-stack, modular generative AI platform for vision-based machine learning ‚Äî created by [Dale Hutchinson](https://daletristanhutchinson.com).

# ZendoAI

**ZendoAI** is an experimental generative AI platform designed to support the entire image model development lifecycle ‚Äî from dataset creation and annotation to model training, fine-tuning, and photorealistic image generation from text prompts.

This project is in its early foundational phase, focused on implementing core functionality in **Rust** and wrapping it in **Python** for integration with machine learning workflows. The long-term vision is to create a modular, performant, and elegant system combining Rust, Python, and Next.js.

## üîç Why ZendoAI?

- Designed for developers and researchers who want full control over their image-based ML pipelines
- Inspired by Zen principles of **clarity**, **intentionality**, and **technical elegance**
- Aims to bridge the performance of systems programming with the flexibility of Python and the accessibility of modern web interfaces

---

## üß™ Current Features

- ‚úÖ Core image-processing functions implemented in **Rust**:
  - Image resizing
  - Aspect-ratio-preserving fit
  - Cropping
- ‚úÖ Python bindings generated for integration with ML workflows
- üõ†Ô∏è Under development:
  - CLI tools for image dataset preprocessing
  - CLI test harness for evaluating Rust bindings

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is under heavy development. Interfaces and folder structure may change frequently.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dale8nson/zendoai.git
cd zendoai
```

### 2. Build Rust library

```bash
cd rust
cargo build --release
```

### 3. Set up Python virtual environment

```bash
cd python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install maturin
maturin develop
```

### 4. Run Python test script

```bash
python test_bindings.py
```

## üå± Why I Built This

ZendoAI reflects my passion for building systems that are not only technically powerful but also thoughtfully designed. It‚Äôs a long-term research project to explore the full lifecycle of generative image models ‚Äî from structured dataset creation to neural network training to interactive synthesis and evaluation.

My goal is to create an open, modular platform that combines:
- The performance of **Rust**
- The flexibility of **Python**
- The accessibility of **modern web UIs**
- The intentionality of **good design**

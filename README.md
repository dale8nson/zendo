## 🔍 What is Zendo.AI?

**Zendo.AI** is a hybrid Rust–Python–Next.js platform for experimenting with image annotation, model training, and generative inference. It’s inspired by Zen aesthetics and designed for long-term modular growth.

This is both a **personal R&D lab** and a **portfolio project**. The goal is to build a toolset where:
- Image datasets can be uploaded, edited, and labeled
- Lightweight models can be trained and tested (CLIP, MobileNet)
- Eventually, generative models can produce new images from structured input

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Canvas API
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Rust (image preprocessing, WASM)
- **ML**: PyTorch, CLIP, StyleGAN2 (planned)
- **Architecture**: Dockerized backend + modular file structure
